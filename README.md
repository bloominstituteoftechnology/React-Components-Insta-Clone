# React-Components-Insta-Clone

## Component Composition Module Project

## Introduction

For this project, you'll be building a simple Instagram clone using React. There is a file provided `frontend/data/dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post. Your React application will receive faux post data and render each as a separate Instagram post.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup

- [ ] Clone the repository to your machine using your terminal.
- [ ]  CD into the project base directory `cd React-Components-Insta-Clone`
- [ ]  Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- [ ]  Start up the app using `npm run dev`
- [ ]  Push commits: git push origin `main`.

### Task 2: MVP

- [ ]  This app can be broken down to two main sections that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar and the Posts.
- [ ]  To complete this project there will be a single instance of the Search Bar being rendered at the top of the page, as well as a Posts component that renders an individual Post for every object inside the `dummy-data.js` array.
- [ ]  Use what you learned to set up state to keep track of the posts.
- [ ]  You will implement a callback to increase the "likes count" on posts, and hand it through props several levels down into a nested component.
- [ ]  Look through the code before you start. There are a lot of files. Not all of them need code added to them. Start in the App.js file and read the instructions there.
