      This function is passed down to nested components through props, allowing them to increase the number of likes of a given post.

      Invoke `setPosts` and pass as the new state the invocation of `posts.map`.
      The callback passed into `map` performs the following logic:
        - if the `id` of the post matches `postId`, return a new post object with the desired values (use the spread operator).
        - otherwise just return the post object unchanged.
